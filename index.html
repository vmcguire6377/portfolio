                <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p>
                    I am Vanessa McGuire and I would like to invite you learn a bit about me, and how we can help eachother. I come from a background in accounting and customer service but quickly
                    felt that was not enough to satisfy my lifelong craving for knowledge and the need for new challenges. And so I began my journey in development, beginning with coding bootcamp 
                    at University of Arizona. Please peruse my page at your leisure to view the projects I've created and the list of skills I will bring to my employment position.

                        I began Mama Bear Child Care Co. as a small licensed in-home day care.  I cared for 6 children ranging in age from 6 weeks to 4 years. I managed all needs of the children including bottle feeding, diaper changing, recognizing the symptoms of common childhood illness and taking the related proper action, cooking, cleaning, sanitizing, behavioral guidance, facilitating emotional attachment, medication administration.

                        In June of 2019, Mama Bear Child Care Co. expanded to a new larger location, and with the addition of new owners, became a child care center by state licensing standards.

I work closely with Child Protective Services to facilitate resource management for foster children. I work with Child Care Resources to facilitate community access to affordable and scholarship supported child care. This year I organized the first annual Thanksgiving food drive for the company. I maintain two company pages on social media, a public page, and a private page for parents. I created our secure website to be fully functional with sufficient content and contact info, at https://mamabearchildcare.net. 
                        Other Duties: Overseeing inspections with the Montana State licensing board and the CACFP food program.

                        2019, Buckets of Love, Volunteer Board Member
                        I volunteer on this non profit organization dedicated to connecting and providing at risk Montana youth with necessary and emergency mental/behavioral health care.  I currently serve on the marketing committee and have written a radio advertisement for one of our local fundraisers, and several other publications. I have sought out and gained donations for Buckets of Love, and represented us in meetings with radio ad management personnel in order to organize and facilitate our PSAs and fundraiser advertisements.
                        10/2014-03/2020, Elevate Church, Volunteer Vocalist/Guitarist
                        I performed as a back-up vocalist/harmonizing vocalist for two services each Sunday, until such time that Elevate reduced to one service.  I participated consistently for approximately two years. Towards the end of my volunteer service in this function I occasionally led songs and delivered scripture in between songs. I also volunteered in cleaning the church occasionally. I have recently been hired as the Worship Leader for Elevate and lead the music with a band each Sunday, manage the music and sound team, deliver relevant scripture and develop special events.
